# Project Images Checklist

- Path: `images/projects/`
- Recommended format: `.webp` (preferred) or `.jpg`
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 (e.g., 1600×900 or 1280×720)
- Max file size: ≤ 300 KB (optimize for web)
- Naming: lowercase, hyphen-separated

## Files to add
- wp2-working-paper-populator.webp (or .jpg)
  - Alt: WP2 Working Paper Populator app interface
- uniexplorer.webp (or .jpg)
  - Alt: UniExplorer university program recommender
- ai-prompt-optimization-tool.webp (or .jpg)
  - Alt: AI Prompt Optimization Tool interface
- member-data-manager.webp (or .jpg)
  - Alt: Member Data Manager dashboard
- multi-cloud-deployment.webp (or .jpg)
  - Alt: Multi-Cloud Deployment pipeline overview
- ai-car-inspector.webp (or .jpg)
  - Alt: AI Car Inspector analysis screen

## Tips
- Keep visuals uncluttered; prefer a single representative screenshot per project.
- If exporting from design tools, export at 2x and then optimize with an image compressor (e.g., Squoosh or TinyPNG).
- Store new project images here following the same naming rules.

## After adding images
- If you want to use these local images in the projects coverflow, I can switch the coverflow to reference:
  - `images/projects/<file-name>.webp` (or `.jpg`) instead of the current remote placeholders.
